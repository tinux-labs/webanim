This example demonstrates a two-phase animation:

- Fade & Scale In â€“ The `.card` element fades in from `opacity: 0` and
  `scale: 0.5` to its natural state (`opacity: 1; scale: 1`) over 2 seconds.
- Looping Bounce â€“ After that, it starts a subtle bounce effect by animating
  `y: -20` with yoyo and infinite repeat.

#### ðŸ§  from vs to in GSAP

- `gsap.from()` animates **from the given values to the element's current values**.
- `gsap.to()` animates **from the element's current values to the given values**.

Use from when you want elements to "appear" into place, and to when you want to
move them away from their current state.
