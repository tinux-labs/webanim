This example demonstrates how to use GSAP to create a basic animation (tween)
and control it with buttons. We use `gsap.from()` to rotate a circle infinitely,
and the buttons allow you to control the animation using methods like
`play()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `restart()`, and `kill()`.

It's a great way to learn how tweens work and how to manipulate them in real
timeâ€”essential for building interactive animations in modern interfaces.

A **tween** is an animation that transitions one or more properties (such as
position, opacity, or rotation) from a starting value to an ending value over a
specific duration.
